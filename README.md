## 🤖 AI Usage Summary

    I used AI tools to support the development process responsibly:
    - ChatGPT → Helped debug my CSS layout (      flexbox vs. media queries), guided me in creating a time-based JavaScript greeting, and suggested improvements to documentation.
    - Benefit → Faster problem-solving and learning best practices.
    - Challenge → Needed to carefully review AI suggestions and adjust them to fit assignment requirements.
    - Learning Outcome → Improved understanding of responsive design and JavaScript DOM manipulation.
