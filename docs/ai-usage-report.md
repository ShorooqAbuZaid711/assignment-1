## ✅ Benefits
    - Learning Aid → Explanations helped understand why code works, not just how.
    - Debugging Help → Identified syntax errors (e.g., fixing innerText("...") to innerText = "...").
    - Better Design Ideas → Improved styling consistency with AI’s suggestions.

---

## ⚠️ Challenges
    - Over-Reliance Risk → Some suggestions needed correction to fully work.
    - Generalized Output → AI-generated code sometimes required adaptation for this project’s structure.
    - Learning vs. Copying → Needed discipline to understand the code, not just paste it.

--- 

## 🔎 Learning Outcomes
    - Improved understanding of responsive design principles using Flexbox and Media Queries.
    - Gained experience in clean documentation writing using Markdown.
    - Practiced responsible use of AI by adapting suggestions and ensuring originality.
